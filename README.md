# Lexart Labs FullStack Test

The project comprises a front-end and back-end that aim to conduct searches on websites selling products, using API and data scraping to return a list of matching products. The server stores the products in a database along with their corresponding terms, categories, and stores, which helps speed up subsequent searches.
